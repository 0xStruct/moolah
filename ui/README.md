# Mina Email UI

This is built with NextJS starter template generated by Mina CLI.

NextJS require recent version of Node v18.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Currently, UI for email verification is provided. Get content of `.eml` file or just copy the raw content of email.
Paste it in the box and click verify button.

If everything goes alright, you will get back the signed proof which looks like below:

```
{
  "data": {
    "emailHash": "CAHSQbUPQ7H_W8+O8-LPcwP5j1SWzAbv1FYg=zVORgLCH0COABA",
    "amount": 1
  },
  "signature": {
    "r": "9719853374619555343428598568308422176695894225224314950615147503700496963109",
    "s": "16661831884946446385904466329604415754404427943004056667816929039421940327726"
  },
  "publicKey": "B62qpjadaypxXev6SUbYZboJAZdu3dYEbTm9geYM2XciYXGx3ZqpFGt"
}
```

Use that proof to claim $Mina from zkApp.

Soon, oracle will be available from NextJS `api` folder as it is to be ported from ExpressJS to run UI and Oracle from the same project.
